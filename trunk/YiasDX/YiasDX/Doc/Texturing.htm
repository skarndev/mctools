<P><FONT size=4>When you have changed the height of the terrain and are happy 
with it (or also before, it doesnt matter) you can go and texture the terrain. 
Thats actually the most important step of the creation. The textures will make 
the terrain interesting.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Before you start to texture you should select some texture you 
would like to use. Thats pretty simple. All you need to do is to open the 
"Textures"-Tab by pressing the Textures-button. Now you should see the 
following:</FONT></P>
<P><IMG alt="" hspace=0 src="Images/04.JPG" align=baseline border=0></P>
<P><FONT size=4>In this interface you can search for the textures you would like 
to use. You can enter the name of the zone the textures should be loaded from 
and press the Load button. This will show you the textures that can be found 
within this zone and display them in the free space. You may pay attention that 
textures that are nearly invisble are maybe only alphamaps that will show up 
strange within wow (or just plain green which means the same as "No 
texture").</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>In this picture you see how it looks after loading a 
tileset:</FONT></P>
<P><IMG alt="" hspace=0 src="Images\05.JPG" align=baseline border=0></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Now you can press on the textures you would like to save and 
use. They will have a purple border around. If you are finished with the 
textures you can press add and move to the next zone if you like and do the same 
again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>After selecting all the textures you like you can close the 
Textures-Tab and open the Texturing-tab. This should then look as following (in 
my case):</FONT></P>
<P><IMG alt="" hspace=0 src="Images\06.JPG" align=baseline border=0></P>
<P><FONT size=4>We find the textures that we added in the other interface and 
some other options. First i will explain those options:</FONT></P>
<OL>
  <LI><FONT size=4>Texturing active: This checkbox determines if we would like 
  to change the terrainheight or if we would like to texture the terrain. 
  Changing the value will display a message in the chatbox to make you 
  remember.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=4>Next you see the textures that are available now. You can 
  press on one of them to make them active (indicated by a purple border). This 
  will also change the text of "Curtex".</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=4>Circle - Square : Select if the brush should be a circle or 
  if it should be a square. Just experiment, pretty simple</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=4>Layers! This is actually the most complex part of it. Every 
  chunk can have up to 4 layers of textures, not more! The lowest layer (layer 
  1) is a fully opaque groundtexture. What it means that its fully opaque you 
  can see if you enable only Layer 1 and then texture a chunk. The other 3 
  layers can be blended using transparencies set in the chunk. Now actually a 
  chunk does not need to have 4 layers it also can have 1 or 2 or 3. But it 
  needs always a layer. Once a chunk has 4 layers and want to set another 
  texture you need to replace another layer because it cannot have 5 layers. 
  Thats basically what you can specify using the first 4 checkboxes (Layer 1 - 
  Layer 4). These checkboxes define which layer gets overwritten if the chunk 
  has 4 layers already.<BR><BR>If you only check the "Free Layer" - box this 
  will mean that it will always use a free layer if there is an unused layer (if 
  the chunk has less then 4 layers). If the chunk has 4 layers already nothing 
  will happen. If you check Free Layer and another Layer - checkbox this will 
  set the following rule: "Take a free layer if one is available, else overwrite 
  layer X".</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=4>Intensity and Gradient: The intensity is not the same value 
  as the intensity in the terrain. The intensity determines how fast the opacity 
  of the new texture grows while you are applying it. The gradient determines 
  how fast the intensity decreases when the distance to the centre increases. A 
  high gradient means a slow loss, a low gradient fast loss.</FONT></LI></OL>
<P><FONT size=4>To texture you should enable texturing, select a texture and 
choose a layer. The following picture show how this then can look:</FONT></P>
<P><IMG alt="" hspace=0 src="Images\07.JPG" align=baseline border=0></P>
<P><FONT size=4>The chunks all had already 2 layers. By setting "Free Layer" the 
program added a third layer with my texture. Now the chunks have 3 Layers. Now i 
took another texture and i didnt change anything else:</FONT></P>
<P><IMG alt="" hspace=0 src="Images\08.JPG" align=baseline border=0></P>
<P><FONT size=4>This texture now used the next free layer, thats the 4th and 
last layer. If we would now take another texture and begin to texture with the 
same settings nothing would happen on these chunks because they already have 4 
layers and therefore there is no free layer left but we have chosen to only take 
free layers --&gt; Nothing to be done. For the last layer we take the second 
layer and overwrite it with a new texture, that looks as following:</FONT></P>
<P><IMG alt="" hspace=0 src="Images\09.JPG" align=baseline border=0></P>
<P><FONT size=4>As you can see some chunks now have a completly different color. 
Thats because they already had 4 Layers and so the editor replaced the layer 2 
with our new texture.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>If you would like to make sure that even with a Layer selected 
in the checkboxes no texture gets overwritten in a chunk place the mouse above 
it and press the f key to lock the chunk. Unlock it by pressing f 
again.</FONT></P>
