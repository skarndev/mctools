<P><FONT size=4>After you have selected the point where you would like to enter 
you should see the world with the userinterface. This looks like that (if you 
are exactly at the same position in the world ;) ).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><IMG alt="" hspace=0 src="Images\02.JPG" align=baseline  border=0></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>First i would like to explain you some basic things.</FONT></P>
<OL>
  <LI><FONT size=4>You can see those red lines all over the terrain. These lines 
  separate chunks. The files of WoW are made of chunks. Every chunk has 145 
  points for which you can set the height. Every chunk can have up to 4 
  different textures blended over eachother.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=4>Also you can see black lines. These lines are always on the 
  same height. So to say these are heightlines. You can set the interval (which 
  is default 20 units) and disable those lines when you click on the "Settings" 
  button.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=4>In the top left you can see the coordinates of the server. 
  The client and the server do not have the same coordinate system. If you would 
  like to teleport to the edited location within WoW you should use the 
  coordinates of the server (e.g. in arcemu with .gps)</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=4>In the middle you see the name of the area of the chunk you 
  are currently hovering with the camera (not where you look at). This is taken 
  from AreaTable.dbc</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=4>On the right you see the name of the currently hovered ADT 
  (actually not really important)</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=4>Under the mouse you can see a blue circle. This circle shows 
  2 things: Where something gets edited and how big the radius is. For example 
  if you raise the terrain it will raise the terrain within this blue circle and 
  not outside it.</FONT></LI></OL>
<P><FONT size=4>Now lets get started. If you like to change the terrain you 
should open the "Terrain"-Tab by pressing the Terrain-button. Now this should 
look like that:</FONT></P>
<P><IMG alt="" hspace=0 src="Images\03.JPG" align=baseline border=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=4>There are 2 important things: The Mode of change and the 
checkbox with "Align models to ground". The rest should be pretty clear. For the 
interpolation just test and get a feeling it doesnt really help to explain what 
it does.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>For the mode of change its also pretty simple. Change height 
just lowers or raises the terrain within the circle. Flatten is a bit different. 
It tries to take out sharp edges in the terrain. It flattens the terrain and 
makes it smooth. If you press on "Flatten" you wont be able to select Flat and 
Quadratic because they do not give nice results. The same is for blur. Also 
there just get a feeling for whats different between Blur and Flatten it doesnt 
really give you a clue if i just explain it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Now lets have a look how the editing of the terrain works. You 
have several possibilities to change it. The first one is to press on the ground 
where you would like to edit and use the key r (raise) or the key l (lower) to 
perform the change. Another possibility is to press CTRL and the left 
mousebutton. That will make the changes always at the point under the 
mousearrow. CTRL has the same effect as the key r, ALT as the key l. And the 
third possibility is to just hold the left mousebutton for more than 1.5 seconds 
and then it will have the same effect as if you would have CTRL pressed until 
you release the mousebutton.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Of course you can also change the radius and the intensity. 
There are basically 2 possibilities to do that. Either you use the scrollbar in 
the terraintab or you use the keyboard. The key i increases the radius, the key 
I decreases the radius. The key v increases the intensity, the key V decreases 
it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>At last i would like to explain the checkbox with "Align models 
to ground". This may be pretty usefull. If you change the height of a piece of 
terrain this may also affect the models on it. But by default the models have a 
fixed position and are not raised automatically if you raise the terrain. So 
maybe the will hang in the air if you lower the terrain or stick in the ground 
if you rise it. If you enable the checkbox this wont happen. The editor checks 
every model and aligns it to the new height.</FONT></P>
