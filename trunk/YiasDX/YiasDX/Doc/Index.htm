<P><FONT size=6><U>YiasEdit DX Documentation</U></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>In the following files you will find a hopefully complete 
documentation of all the features you have present in YiasEdit DX as well as 
some tips and tricks to make handling a bit easier for you. Of course it can be 
that it wont cover every question and aspect of the program. If so dont hesitate 
to contact me on <A href="http://www.yias.de">www.yias.de</A> or <A 
href="http://www.mmowned.com">www.mmowned.com</A>. There you will find threads 
about the program where you can post questions and suggestions (which actually 
are the most important of it all as i dont every single wish of the community by 
heart ;) ).<BR><BR>First I would like to tell you some basic things about the 
different files you can find in the folder where the YiasDX.exe lies.</FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT size=4>YiasDX.exe : This is the main executable of the program. It 
  contains all the code to render and modify the files of WoW. You can start it 
  without the launcher but its recommended to start the launcher to check for 
  updates and then use the "Start"-button from the launcher to start the 
  program. 
  <LI>Launcher.exe : The main purpose of the launcher is to make sure that you 
  always have the newest version of the program. As there may be several 
  versions that are uploaded a day because some major errors were fixed its 
  pretty important to start the program always with the launcher. It also makes 
  sure that you know if you have actually the newest version or if i uploaded 
  something new what can get pretty difficult if there is only a simple 
  download. There is button called "Start" which will just open the YiasDX.exe 
  and has basically the same effect like opening the YiasDX.exe 
  <LI>VS_1.fx, VS_2.fx, VS_3.fx, VS_4.fx : These files are shaders for DirectX. 
  When it comes to render a pixel the engine and the graphics card have a fixed 
  function pipeline. Vertices get transformed by the WorldViewProj-matrix, 
  polygons get tesselated and so on. This is fixed and done always the same way. 
  A lot of effects are pretty simpler if you could do it pixel by pixel 
  dynamically after all the transformation. Thats where we find shaders. Shaders 
  allow to program on this fixed function pipeline. So basically you can very 
  simple change the fashion of the rendering by editing this shaders. Its though 
  not recommended to massivly change the shaders without the knowledge of it. 
  You can perform some simple things like multiplying some color-channels and 
  watch the effects. This of course has to be done in every .fx file. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=4>LVersion.dll : This DLL contains the current version of your 
  build. The launcher uses this DLL to determine the current version. If no DLL 
  is found or if its corrupt you get the version -1 which of course is always 
  less than the remote version.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=4>Locale-xxXX.txt : This files (where xxXX specifies a locale 
  like enGB, deDE, frFR, ...) contains translations of the texts in the editor. 
  Nearly every text displayed there can be changed. The editor reads the locale 
  from WoW and searches for a Locale-xxXX.txt where xxXX matches the locale 
  read. textures.MPQ : This file contains a list with all the tilesets and the 
  matching textures. This is needed by the editor to be able to load the 
  textures very fast. If you like to add a custom tileset with your textures do 
  the following: Open the Tilesets.txt in the textures.MPQ. At the end enter the 
  name of your tileset (It should not contain any illegal characters for 
  windows-paths like \ / ? * and so on). Then create a file with the name of 
  your tileset (it should not have an extension). Into this file write the 
  absolut MPQ-paths of all the textures. Then place this file and the new 
  Tilsets.txt in the textures.MPQ and you can acces the textures within the 
  textureselection-UI with the name of your tileset.</FONT></LI></UL>
