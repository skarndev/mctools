have pressed on one of the buttons indicating the different continents available 
to edit allows you to select where you would like to start editing the world. 
This screen will look similar to the following picture (depending on which 
continent you choose):<BR><BR><IMG alt="" hspace=0 src="Images\01.JPG"  align=baseline border=0></FONT> </P>

<P><FONT size=4>Actually its pretty simple. The map you see here was generated 
from the WDL-file of the selected continent. These files contain information 
about the height of the terrain and WoW uses those files to render the 
background when you are far away from a specific point. I use it to get the 
shape of the terrain ;). The black lines you see separate each ADT from the 
other ones so you know where the border of the ADT are. In the top left you see 
a little lable that shows you the X/Z - offset of the ADT that is currently 
under the mouse-pointer. This refers to the name (like Kalimdor_40_29.adt). If 
you would like to calculate the clientposition of that ADT just calculate X: x * 
533.333 Y: Not set Z: z * 533.333. From there you get the coordinates of the 
server by calculating X: (32 - x) * 533.333 Y: (32 - z) * 533 Z: Not 
set.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>As the text on the bottom shows you can move and zoom this map. 
The mousewheel lets you zoom in and out and by holding the right mousebutton and 
moving the mouse you can pan around when the map is zoomed in.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>If you found the desired place just press the left mousebutton 
and loading starts!</FONT></P><A href="Index.htm">Back!</A>
