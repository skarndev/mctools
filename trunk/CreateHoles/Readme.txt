Reworked Cryect's WoW Tools Release 0.11 by Tigurius
So I decided to rework Cryects PatchHoles.exe to make it possible to create Holes ;)
Usage:
CreateHoles <adt file> <chunk> <holes>- Creates a hole in the given chunk(you can use values from 0 to 255) with the value of <holes>, if no chunk is given it will remove all holes^^
