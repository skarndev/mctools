KNOWN ISSUES:

v0.5:
- secondary water color is missing
- outdoor fog not complete
- indoor fog too dense when viewed from a distance
- lighting is still not 100% correct
- transparent polygons aren't depth-sorted; this means that there might be some artifacts around partially transparent objects like tree leaves.
- slowdown in some areas like outside Stormwind or the Undercity
- as the program loads new areas of the map it will cause short pauses :(
- still eats a lot of RAM
