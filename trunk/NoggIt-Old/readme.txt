WoWmapview - World of Warcraft 3D map viewer

This program displays the game world of WoW and allows you to fly and explore anywhere.
An installed WoW client is required to use this program.

Running the program:
run wowmapview.exe to start it in the default settings: 1024x768 fullscreen.
run windowed.cmd to start it in windowed mode without opening a command line

To run it in different resolutions or in a window, you will have to specify command line parameters, see below.

Command line parameters:
	-w		windowed mode
	-f		fullscreen mode
	-p		use patch.mpq
	-np		omit patch.mpq
	-1280x1024	different resolution (most common resolutions work)

In the main menu, you can select a world on the left or choose one of the bookmarked locations available.
Click on the map to enter the world in the given location. For worlds without maps, click anywhere to enter.

You can always exit back to the main menu with the Esc key; pressing Esc at the main menu will exit the program.


Navigating the game world is done using the mouse and the keyboard: use the mouse to look around, press I to invert the vertical axis.
You can fly forward and backwards using the W and S keys, and strafe left and right with A and D.
A description of further key commands is available in the main menu.
